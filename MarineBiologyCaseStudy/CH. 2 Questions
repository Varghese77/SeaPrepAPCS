Analysis Question Set 1:
	1. SimpleMBSDemo2 initializes its own fish objects and links them to an environment. Then SimpleMBSDemo2 initializes a Simulation 
	   object that references the same environment. The environment interface has an allObjects() method that returns an array of locatables 
	   to the simulation and because objects in arrays are references the simulation object can act upon the fish objects and afterwards the display 
	   will reflect the new updates to the fish objects. 
	2. Demo1 doesn't use a simulation object while demo2 does. This means that Demo1 makes the fish directly while Demo2 
	   refers to the simulation object to update the fish in timesteps. 
	
Analysis Question Set 2: 
	1. The returned locations would be (7,2), (7,4), (8,3), and (6,3).
	2. The value of dir1 should be East.
	3. The value of dir2 should be South and the value of dir3 should be North. 
	4. loc3 refers to location (6,3). 
	5. loc4 refers to location (5,3). 
	6. The Direction class has three constructors, one with no parameters, one that takes a direction in degrees 
	   and one that takes the direction from string form. The other methods not used that the Direction class has(in the form 
	   return type, name(parameters)) is int inDegrees(), boolean Equals() , Direction toRight(), Direction toRight(int degrees), 
	   Direction toLeft(), Direction toLeft(int degrees), Direction reverse(), Direction randomDIrection(), int hashCode(), 
	   and Direction roundedDir(int numDirections, Direction startingDir). The Location Class has one constructor which takes 
	   two integers as parameters, the first representing the row and the second representing the column. The other methods not used 
	   in the Location class are int row(), int column(), boolean equals(Object other), int CompareTo(Object other), String toString(),  
	   and int hashCode(). The toString methods in both of these classes could be used to get information in the form of a string to
	   be displayed so that the user can automatically get information about the direction of a fish and its location in an easy way
	   assuming the user didn't know the inner structure of the code. The ToRight method adds a certain amount of degrees to the direction 
	   that it is called on, either by 90 if no parameters are passed or by the amount passed as a parameter. the toLeft does the exact 
	   same thing except subtracting degrees instead of adding them. 
Exercise Set 1:
	1. Driver (Main Class) created. 
	2. the constant NORTH is represented by 0 degrees, EAST is represented by 90 degrees, SOUTH is represented by 180 degrees, and WEST is represented by 270 degrees. 
	   The value of dir3 in degrees is 0 because it is North.
